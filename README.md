Earthquakes are one of the most devastating natural disasters. They usually happen without 
warning and don't give individuals much time to react. As a result, earthquakes can cause major 
injuries and loss of life, as well as demolish massive buildings and infrastructure, resulting in 
significant economic loss. 

Machine learning has the ability to advance our knowledge of earthquakes and enable more accurate forecasting and catastrophic response. It is crucial to develop accurate and dependable prediction models for earthquakes as we can avoid significant losses and it still needs more study as it is complicated and a difficult topic to predict.

In order to anticipate earthquakes, machine learning may be used to examine seismic data trends. Seismometers capture seismic data, which may be used to spot changes to the earthâ€™s surface, like seismic waves brought on by earthquakes. Machine learning algorithm may utilize these patterns to forecast the risk of an earthquake happening in a certain region by studying these patterns and learning to recognize key traits that are linked to seismic activity. 

This project explores the use of machine learning models, such as Random Forest Classifier for predicting the Earthquakes more accurately. Key features include Earthquake catalogue, Feature Calculation, Feature Selection and Train with Machine Learning Model, Prediction Model and the Result. Results include the magnitude  of earthquake and the impact of earthquake.
